Hyperskill Project: Password Hacker
sockets, itertools, json, datetime

The tasks implemented in the folder "hacking_my_part":
- open connection to the server
- try all possible combinations [a-z0-9]+ of different length  and try if server accepts it as a password
- read typical logins and passwords from the files and send them in a json format to the server as auth info
- capitalize in different combinations the passwords from the file and try to connect with them
- measure the server response time and generate password based on the alleged response time vulnerability


Other folders are education system's checks (creation of the server on the local host and starting tests execution).
